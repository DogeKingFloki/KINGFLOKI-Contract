# Doge King Floki


The central philosophy of DogeKingFloki is the belief that projects can be done fairer, more sustainably, and in a way that can benefit everyone involved. No large corporation or company is looking to extract personal data from the users for advertising or maximize profits for yearly reports. DogeKingFloki simply wants people to have fun, interact with each other freely, have access to opportunities that lead to financial freedom, and work towards the next stage in the evolution of the internet and online interaction. We have seen poor outcomes when projects are developed in greedy, unsustainable, or deceptive ways. We want to create something that rises above all these methods. DogeKingFloki will be empowering, transparent, fun, healthy, and fair.


DogeKingFloki believes strongly in decentralization, holding this value at the core of everything it does. Decentralization gives everyone equal opportunity to be involved and utilize their strengths to help a project grow and the freedom to decide how. There is a social responsibility to provide tools and resources in the virtual space to create a fun and adaptive environment for individuals to thrive and monetize, no matter who or where they are.
